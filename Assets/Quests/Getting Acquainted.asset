  QDesc: "Greetings adventurer, I'm Gallius!\n\nIm glad the guild has sent you here
    to help, beyond this point the forest is filled with hostile arachnids. We've
    been fighting them off for days, but they just keep coming. I was hoping you
    would help us find the source of this corruption and find a way to stop it.\n\nBut,
    first things first. You and the arachnids need to get acquainted, go into the
    forest and exterminate, lets say... 5 spiders. After youve done that come back
    to me and ill give your next task. \n\nGood luck, and dont look them in the eyes,
    its super creepy."
  QObj: Slay 5 Arachnids in the Giftwoods.
