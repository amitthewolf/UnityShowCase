  QName: Tak'talla the Grudge-bearer
  QDesc: "Good, you survived!  I didn't wanna scare you before but you're the fifth
    adventurer they sent me to help, I was starting to think I'd have to do it myself,
    but thankfully it seems your reliabe enough.\n\nSo, you can kill spiders - that's
    good, because your next step will take you to their hatchery which will no doubt
    be well-gaurded. But, there's a catch - You're gonna need to find it first. I
    know, you'd think a huge spider den would be easily spotted, but somehow it isn't.
    \n\nTry speaking with Tak'talla the ancient tree, hes kind of an asshole so try
    and be nice. He won't tell me where the den is because he caught me defecating
    near a tree once, and apparently it was his daughter or something. Anyway, hes
    in the north-eastern part of this valley.\n\nOh, and just to make sure, dont
    defecate. Like at all."
