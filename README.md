# UnityShowCase
A fast-paced Unity Action RPG made in unity by Amit Wolf.
This project was made as a showcase of my capabilities in Unity. It was made in a short amount of time while learning the engine from scratch. The game was made 
with the role of using the expected tools of a unity developer - including Design Patterns, Linq, Events, Particle Systems, UI Elements and more.

Below is a link to the Executable Build version which can be downloaded from my GoogleDrive:
